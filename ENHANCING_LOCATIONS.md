# This should describe how we enhance location metadata.

1. Any location ideally has both japanase and english naming, so that ultimately the address card can be shown to a Japanese speaker.
2. We want to try and find the storefront image on Google, and use that image whenever the location is shown on a listing. 
3. We want to also double check that the english name matches the japanese name and matches the address.
