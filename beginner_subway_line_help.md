Here are the specific logistical tips for your morning journey.

### **1\. The One App You Need**

For a US tourist, **Google Maps** is the absolute best tool.

* **Why:** It tells you exactly which train car to get on (e.g., "Car 4 is best for easy transfer"), which station exit to use, and calculates the cost.  
* **Pro Tip:** Download **"Japan Travel by NAVITIME"** as a backup if you need to filter routes specifically for "Rail Pass" or "Taxi only," but for simple subway rides, Google Maps is superior.

### **2\. Location of the Station (Daimon)**

The closest entrance to the Prince Park Tower is **Daimon Station, Exit A6**. It is about a 9-10 minute walk from your hotel lobby.

* **Google Maps Link:**([https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1\&query=Daimon+Station+Exit+A6+Minato+Tokyo](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api%3D1%26query%3DDaimon%2BStation%2BExit%2BA6%2BMinato%2BTokyo))  
* **Walking Directions:** Exit the hotel, walk through Shiba Park towards the big "Gate" of Zojoji Temple. With the gate on your left, keep walking straight until you hit the main street (Hibiya-dori). The A6 exit is right near the intersection.

### **3\. Step-by-Step Guide: Daimon to Ginza**

Since you are doing this for the first time, here is the "dummy-proof" breakdown:  
**Step A: Payment (New for 2025\)**

* **The 2025 Method:** As of this year, Toei Subway (which operates the Asakusa Line) has installed **contactless credit card readers** at many gates. If you see a reader on the ticket gate with a Visa/Mastercard contactless symbol, you can just tap your US credit card or iPhone to enter.  
* **The Classic Method:** If you don't see that reader, use a **Suica** or **Pasmo** card (which you can add directly to your Apple Wallet on your iPhone without buying a physical card).

**Step B: The Train Ride (10 minutes)**

1. Enter **Daimon Station** and follow the **Rose/Pink** signs for the **Toei Asakusa Line**.  
2. Look for Platform 2 (usually) heading towards **Oshiage** or **Narita Airport**.  
3. Board the train.  
4. Get off at **Higashi-Ginza Station (A11)**. It is only 2 stops away (Daimon \-\> Shimbashi \-\> Higashi-Ginza).

**Step C: The "Underground Walk" to Ginza**

* **The Secret:** You do *not* need to get on another train. Higashi-Ginza Station and Ginza Station are effectively one giant complex connected by a long underground hallway.  
* **Action:** When you get off at Higashi-Ginza, look for **Yellow Signs** that say "Ginza Station" or "Hibiya Line / Ginza Line."  
* **The Walk:** You will walk straight through the underground passage (approx. 4-5 minutes). You will eventually see the department store entrances (like **Mitsukoshi**) on your left and right. This puts you directly in the center of Ginza without waiting at traffic lights.

Summary Plan:  
Walk to Daimon A6 \-\> Tap phone at gate \-\> Asakusa Line (2 stops) \-\> Get off at Higashi-Ginza \-\> Walk underground 5 mins \-\> Arrive in Ginza.
