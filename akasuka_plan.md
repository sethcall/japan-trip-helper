2. The "Dry Route" Strategy (Before 11:00 AM)

If it is raining heavily, follow this modified route to minimize outdoor exposure:

08:00 AM – 09:00 AM: The Underground Arrival Instead of walking on the street from the station, use the Asakusa Underground Street (Asakusa Chikagai). It is one of the oldest underground shopping streets in Japan and connects the Tobu Asakusa Station area towards the Shin-Nakamise area. It has a retro, Showa-era atmosphere that is an attraction in itself.

09:00 AM – 10:00 AM: Covered Culture & Views Head to the Asakusa Culture Tourist Information Center (opens 9:00 AM) located directly opposite the Kaminarimon Gate.

    Why: It is fully indoors. You can take the elevator to the 8th-floor observation deck, which is covered and offers a dry vantage point to look down at the temple complex and the rainy streets below.

10:00 AM – 11:00 AM: The "Arcade" Detour Instead of walking down the wet Nakamise-dori, walk through the Shin-Nakamise arcade (fully roofed).

    Activity: Visit the Edo Taito Traditional Crafts Center (opens 10:00 AM), located in the nearby covered Hisago-dori arcade. This allows you to see authentic local crafts (woodworking, cut glass, silverware) in a museum-quality setting without getting wet.

Transport Hack: The Rickshaw If the rain is discouraging you from walking between these spots, the Rickshaws (Jinrikisha) are an excellent investment on a rainy day.

    Rain Proofing: The rickshaws are equipped with canvas roofs and waterproof lap covers/blankets that wrap you up completely.[]

    Benefit: The drivers know exactly which streets are covered and can drop you off right at the temple steps or restaurant entrances, effectively acting as a "door-to-door" dry transport service.
