The matcha latte was a bit more milky so hard to taste the matcha. The pancakes are not soft, they are a scone pastry, I personally like scones so I enjoyed the pancakes. The chocolate syrup was a good addition\!”

Good good not bad Star rating: 4.3 out of 5 stars 4.3 · Price range: ¥1–1,000 ¥1 to ¥1,000 Category: 📍 Coffee shop Open · Closes 10:00 PM Click to open side panel for more information “There’s a small café tucked away in a corner of the bustling Shibuya district with a funny name: Good Good Not Bad.

We were in need of coffee, so finding this spot that wasn’t crowded or didn't have a long queue was a relief. It was even better when I discovered they offered gluten-free muffins and cookies. As someone who typically follows a gluten-free and lactose-free diet for health reasons (though I don’t feel the need to stick to it while on vacation), it was a pleasant surprise. I immediately decided to try the raspberry muffin\!

The only drawback is that it is a café without seating. While there are steel bars available to sit on, they are not intended for longer (or comfortable) seating. This design choice is likely intentional, and that's perfectly fine.”

MATCHA patisserie Sadaharu AOKI Star rating: 4.1 out of 5 stars 4.1 Category: 🍰 Bakery Closed · Opens Monday 11:00 AM Click to open side panel for more information “Edit: changed from 4 to 3 stars. We tried going numerous times again, but the granita is always sold out. Wasted our time coming a lot and it kinda ruined our days.

We had the regular matcha latte and the matcha granita. The matcha latte was exactly what you would expect, good quality, decent sweetness and decent amount of matcha. The granita was the big surprise: very sweet but the amount of matcha was like an atom bomb on our tounges. This was very unexpected but we really liked it. Will come back for another granita, but not for the people that aren't used to a very strong matcha taste.”
