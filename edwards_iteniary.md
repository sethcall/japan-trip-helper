## Pre-Departure Information

### Japan: What to Know Before you Go!

**EMERGENCY CONTACTS**
Kelly Carmon 501-529-1762

**Money & Payments**
*   **Cash is king:** While credit cards are accepted in many hotels and larger shops, smaller restaurants, izakayas, and local vendors often prefer cash. We used a lot of coins at temples, shrines, games, drink machines, etc.
*   **ATMs:** Not all ATMs accept foreign cards, but you can reliably use those at 7-Eleven, Lawson, & FamilyMart
*   **Currency:** The Japanese Yen (¥). Bring some cash upon arrival, especially for taxis, temple donations, and rural areas. You can put in a request at your home bank ahead of time with 2-3 days notice.

**Tipping Etiquette**
*   **No tipping:** Unlike in the U.S., tipping is not customary and can even be considered rude at meals, transfers, group experiences.
*   **Tipping for Private Experiences:** A cash tip is always appreciated for exceptional private guides or experiences. If you would like to leave a small tip (10-12% is fine) it needs to be handed to the guide directly in a small, clean envelope.
*   **Service charge included:** High-end restaurants or hotels may add a service fee automatically.

**Weather in December**
*   Daytime Highs: Around 50–55°F
*   Evening Lows: Around 35–40°F
*   Rain: Minimal — December is among the driest months
*   Sunset: Around 4:45–5:00 PM

**What to Expect:**
*   Cool mornings and evenings, but mild days perfect for exploring temples, gardens, and city walks.
*   Air is crisp and clean, with great visibility for photos.
*   Occasional frost in Kyoto and the countryside, but rarely snow.

**What to Pack:**
*   Warm layers — sweater, medium-to-heavy coat, scarf, and gloves for evenings.
*   Comfortable shoes with traction for temple paths and uneven streets.
*   Easy layers since indoor spaces are heated.

**Cultural Norms**
*   **Politeness:** Bowing is the standard greeting. A slight head nod is fine for visitors.
*   **Shoes off:** Always remove shoes before entering someone’s home, traditional inns (ryokan), temples, and some restaurants. Look for slippers provided. Carry extra socks in your purse if you're wearing sandals
*   **Quiet in public:** Keep conversations low on trains and buses; avoid phone calls.
*   **Respecting space:** Stand to the side when on escalators to let others pass.
*   **Punctuality:** Trains, tours, and reservations run on time—plan to arrive early.

### Public Transportation
*   **Trains & subways:** The best way to get around. They are clean, efficient, and highly punctual.
*   **IC cards:** Download the U.S. Suica app before departing and connect to your Apple Wallet for easy boarding.
*   **Etiquette:** Line up to board, wait for passengers to exit first, and avoid eating on local trains (except on long-distance ones where food is common).

### Ubers and Taxis
Uber works in Japan but is limited to larger cities like Tokyo, Osaka, and Kyoto. GO and JapanTaxi are the most popular local apps, both available in English. You can use them to request rides, track your driver, and pay by credit card. Taxis also accept cash, credit cards, or IC cards like Suica and Pasmo for contactless payment.

At many major train stations or hotels in Japan, you’ll notice two taxi lines:
*   **Regular Taxi Line:** These are standard taxis, and most drivers speak little or no English. They’re perfectly fine for anyone to use. Non-Japanese travelers take them all the time. Just have your destination written in Japanese (your hotel concierge or Google Maps can help) or show the driver your phone map. *GET IN THESE LINES IF YOU ARE COMFORTABLE WITH THE DRIVER NOT SPEAKING ENGLISH BECAUSE THEY MOVE SO MUCH FASTER*
*   **Foreign-Friendly or English-Speaking Taxi Line:** Some larger stations like Tokyo Station or Kyoto Station have a separate queue for taxis with English-speaking drivers. These are fewer in number and may take longer to arrive but are great if you want easier communication.

All taxis in Japan are safe, metered, and regulated. Even if your driver doesn’t speak English, you’ll still get a polite, efficient ride. Doors open automatically, tipping isn’t expected, and payment by card or Suica is common in larger cities.

### Suica Card
*   Works on nearly all trains, subways, and buses in Tokyo, Kyoto, Osaka, and most of Japan’s major cities.
*   Can also be used at convenience stores, vending machines, and even some restaurants.
*   It’s a stored-value (prepaid) card — you load money and tap in/out at train gates or to pay for small purchases.
*   Perfect for short-distance city travel and everyday use.
*   You can add it to Apple Wallet (via the U.S. Suica app) for easy tap-and-go access.

### JR Pass (Japan Rail Pass)
*   A multi-day pass that gives unlimited travel on JR-operated trains, including the Shinkansen (bullet trains) between cities like Tokyo, Kyoto, Osaka, Hiroshima, etc.
*   Must be purchased before arriving in Japan (for most visitors).
*   Covers long-distance travel, but not all local subways or private rail lines within cities (like Tokyo Metro or Kyoto’s city subway).
*   Best for travelers moving between multiple regions — not necessary if you’re staying in just one or two cities.

**In short:**
Use Suica for daily local transport within cities.
Use a JR Pass if you’ll be traveling frequently between cities by train (like Tokyo → Kyoto → Osaka).
You can easily use both — Suica for local rides, JR Pass for the long-distance legs.

### Quick Tips for First-Timers
*   Check your phone carrier pre-departure to make sure you have an international plan set up or download an e-sim
*   Trash bins are rare—carry a small bag for your trash until you find one.
*   Learn a few key phrases:
    *   Hello = *Konnichiwa*
    *   Thank you = *Arigatou gozaimasu*
    *   Excuse me / sorry = *Sumimasen*

### Must-Have Apps for Japan
*   **Google Maps** – The go-to navigation tool for Japan. It shows train lines, platforms, fares, and walking routes with ease. *WORKS SO MUCH BETTER THAN APPLE MAPS*
*   **Google Translate** – Essential for translating signs, menus, and conversations. Use the camera feature for real-time translations.
*   **Japan Travel by NAVITIME** – Great for train and transit routes throughout Japan, including regional lines and longer journeys.
*   **Mobile Suica** – A digital IC card app for seamless train travel and contactless payments (especially on iPhones).
*   **WHATSAPP** – The primary messaging app used in Japan. Useful if you’re in touch with local guides or need to communicate easily.

### Perfume & Cologne in Restaurants
*   **Fragrance-free dining:** Many Japanese restaurants (especially high-end sushi counters and kaiseki dining) have an unspoken **no-strong-fragrance policy**.
*   **Why?** Strong scents interfere with the delicate aromas and flavors of the cuisine, which chefs and diners take seriously.

### Popular Japanese Dishes to Try
*   **Sushi (寿司)** – Vinegared rice with seafood, egg, or vegetables. Includes nigiri, maki rolls, and sashimi (fish only).
*   **Kaiseki (懐石)** – A traditional multi-course fine dining meal showcasing seasonality and artistry.
*   **Tempura (天ぷら)** – Lightly battered, fried seafood or vegetables.
*   **Ramen (ラーメン)** – Wheat noodles in broth with toppings like pork, egg, and vegetables; many regional variations.
*   **Udon (うどん)** – Thick wheat noodles, served hot in broth or chilled.
*   **Soba (そば)** – Thin buckwheat noodles, served hot or cold with dipping sauce.
*   **Okonomiyaki (お好み焼き)** – A savory cabbage pancake with toppings and sauce.
*   **Takoyaki (たこ焼き)** – Octopus-filled batter balls, a street food favorite.
*   **Yakitori (焼き鳥)** – Grilled chicken skewers, served in izakaya pubs.
*   **Donburi (丼ぶり)** – Rice bowls with toppings like beef (*gyudon*) or pork cutlet (*katsudon*).
*   **Shabu-Shabu (しゃぶしゃぶ)** – Hot pot dining with thinly sliced meats and vegetables cooked at the table.

### Pre Departure Customs Forms
**Digital submission (recommended)**
*   You can submit your **Customs Declaration** in advance through Visit Japan Web — this is now the preferred and fastest way.
*   After submitting online, you'll receive a **QR code** to present at customs upon arrival.
*   **Benefits:** Faster processing, shorter lines, no need to fill out a paper form on the plane.
