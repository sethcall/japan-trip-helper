# Blog for 2025-12-21, Sunday in Tokyo

To start the day, the Calls left their hotel at **7:30AM**, and went to Le Pain Quotident, a tourist friendly french bakery. It was fairly good, but nothing outstanding.

We then walked to Ginza from the restuarant, which took us past some shrines. It was cold (47F) and overcast, but not raining. As we walked to Ginza, we also came across a bunch of stalls already open which were very small restuarants serving cheap food.

We kept on walking towards Ginza, then stopping by Shimibusa crossing/station. Still it was only **9:00AM**, and nothing was open yet. So we scoped out some of the places we wanted to go; Uniqlo topped the list. We tried to find a small shrine, and we did, but it seemed closed so we carried on.

The coolest thing we did was finding the Studio Ghibli creator of a Howl's Moving Castle insprired clock, which we got to watch come alive, which it does every hour.

Finally, we went to Ginza 6 shopping area to 'stall' while Uniqlo still wasn't open yet, and got some matchas and teas in a basement of the shopping ear. We sat next to a rude looking guy who had golden shoes and thought he was all that; he wasn't.

We finally got to go to Uniqlo, which is a 12 story flagship store. We all got some clothes, very cool and cheap stuff.

We then walked to a Menya Nobunaga restaurant, which was very good; Isabelle got the best wagyu ramen. It was about $50 which we did not notice; worth every penny.

Anyway, we then tried to take the subway back to our room, and it ended in disaster because we did not know you couldn't use a VISA card (a single one) to let 4 people in to the subway, and got a really annoyed guy to help us as we tried to leave the subway.

We crashed in our rooms at around **3:00PM** until **7:00PM**, fell asleep, way jetlagged still.

We then summoned enough energy to go eat dinner; we decided though to first go to the nearby Tokyo Tower; we found a decent Udon place at the base of it; ate there, shopped around at all the souvenir stuff, and eventually bought tickets for both the main view of the Tower, and the top section (Tokyo Tawa).
