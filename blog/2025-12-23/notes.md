This was the 1st full day that both Edwards and Call could spend all day together.

Matt & Grace got going the earliest, starting at 7:00AM to eat the awesome breakfast buffet at the Hotel.  

We were all down there by 7:30AM, all ate and took a stop by our rooms; by 8:15AM, we were walking towards Teamlabs Borderless at Azabudai Hills, a fancy 'mini town'. We found Garden Plaza B, and stalled because we got there 20 minutes too early.  A steady stream of Japanese people on their way to work streamed by here, just absolutely non-stop while we wandered around.

Teamlabs Borderless was this digital art exhibit where the walls were alive with art, and your presence could affect what was shown.  Anyway, we spent about 1.5 hours there, and when we left, we then went to a 7-11 and then wandered around some more; basically stalling until 12:00, to meet our tour guide, a Mr. Chiraki (Chaz) Toyoi.  He was a very nice man, and showed us around the Tsukiji Outdoor Market, and we had great small fish, wagyu, and desserts across many stalls.  And coffee/matcha at the end.    We then bought some chopstick holders (the Calls did, anyway), and then walked to Ginza, where we went to the top floor of Ginza 6 (an indoor mall), where the girls ice-skated, we parted ways with Mry Toyoi (and gave him money in an envelope or something).  

Seth/Gazell want to GU to try and find men's pants or shoes; they had no 'Large' shoes, and the pants fit incredily poorly for Seth.  

We then all collected back together, and had Isabelle lead the way back through the Subways.
