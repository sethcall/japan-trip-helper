# **The Sunday Strategy: Shiba Park Morning & Ginza Afternoon**

## **1\. Introduction: The 7:00 AM Advantage**

Starting your Sunday at 7:00 AM is a strategic masterstroke in Tokyo. While the commercial city sleeps until 11:00 AM, the temples and parks are open, silent, and atmospheric. This itinerary utilizes the early hours for local exploration in Shiba Park (where you are) and moves you to **Ginza** (the "proper city center") just as the shops open, maximizing your day without wasting time waiting for doors to unlock.

## **2\. The 7:00 AM Walking Loop: "Steps of Success" & Morning Air**

Your hotel is situated in a "green island" perfect for a morning walk. This loop requires no trains and takes advantage of the early light.

### **2.1 Zojoji Temple (Grounds Open)**

* **Time:** 07:15 – 07:45  
* **The Experience:** While the main hall opens later for prayer, the massive temple grounds are accessible. In the quiet Sunday morning air, the contrast between the 400-year-old **Sangedatsumon Gate** and the red steel of **Tokyo Tower** right behind it is most striking.  
* **Don't Miss:** The *Sentai Kosodate Jizo* (rows of stone statues with red caps) on the right side of the main hall. In the morning stillness, this area is profound and photogenic.

### **2.2 Atago Shrine: The Physical Challenge**

* **Time:** 07:50 – 08:30  
* **Location:** A 15-minute walk north from Zojoji.  
* **The "Steps of Success":** This shrine sits atop the highest natural hill in the 23 wards. It is famous for the steep "Stone Steps of Success." Legend says a samurai rode his horse up these stairs to deliver plum blossoms to the Shogun. Climbing them on foot is said to boost your career success.  
* **Morning Vibe:** It is a serene "power spot" with shrine cats often roaming the grounds. It’s a great way to wake up the body before breakfast.\[1, 2\]

## **3\. Breakfast: The "Easy" Morning Meal**

Finding sit-down breakfast in Tokyo before 9:00 AM can be difficult, but you are in luck.

### **3.1 Le Pain Quotidien (Shiba Park)**

* **Status:** **Highly Recommended**  
* **Opens:** 7:30 AM  
* **Why here:** Located directly in Shiba Park (near the Prince Park Tower), this bakery-restaurant offers a warm, rustic atmosphere. It serves excellent coffee, bread baskets, and egg dishes. It is very family-friendly and allows you to stay within the park’s greenery while you fuel up for the day.

## **4\. The City Center Move: Ginza (Shopping & "Norma")**

Around 10:00 AM, take a taxi (approx. 10-15 mins) or the subway (Asakusa Line from Daimon to Higashi-Ginza) to **Ginza**. This is Tokyo’s premier shopping district and fits your request for a "proper city center."

### **4.1 The "Norma" Shop: Standard Products (Ginza Flagship)**

You mentioned looking for a "popular Norma shop." This is likely **Standard Products**, a new brand by Daiso that has become a massive hit in Japan. It features minimalist, high-quality household goods (often compared to Muji but cheaper).

* **Location:** **Marronnier Gate Ginza 2** (6th Floor).  
* **Why it fits:** It opens at 11:00 AM. This complex houses the global flagships for **DAISO**, **Standard Products**, and **THREEPPY** all on one floor. It is the ultimate destination for "quirky," useful, and uniquely Japanese affordable goods.

### **4.2 Other Essential Ginza Stops**

* **Uniqlo Tokyo (Flagship):** Also in Marronnier Gate. This is the global flagship with custom t-shirt printing and flower shops inside.  
* **Itoya (Stationery):** A 12-story stationary store that feels like a museum. It opens at 10:00 AM on Sundays, making it a perfect first stop before Standard Products opens.  
* **Pedestrian Paradise:** From 12:00 PM on Sundays, the main street of Ginza (Chuo-dori) is closed to cars, allowing you to walk freely in the middle of the road.

## **5\. Desserts: The "Mont Blanc" Experience**

You asked for a dessert "hard to find in the US." The **Mont Blanc** (a cake made of chestnut cream vermicelli) is iconic in Japan but rare in the States.

### **5.1 Ginza Miyuki-kan**

* **The Dish:** Their Mont Blanc is legendary—a mountain of chestnut cream over a meringue base. It is less sweet than American desserts and focuses on the earthy, nutty flavor of the chestnut.  
* **Atmosphere:** A classic, retro-European style kissaten (coffee shop) that feels distinctly "Tokyo in the 80s."

### **5.2 Alternative: The Department Store Basements (Depachika)**

* **Location:** **Ginza Mitsukoshi** or **Matsuya Ginza** (Basement floors).  
* **The Experience:** If the family can't decide, go here. You will find glass cases filled with art-like cakes, wagashi (traditional sweets), and fruits. It is a visual spectacle and you can buy individual items to bring back to the hotel.

## **6\. The "Quirky" & Culture Fix**

### **6.1 Advertising Museum Tokyo (Caretta Shiodome)**

* **Why:** If you walk from Hamamatsucho towards Ginza, you pass Shiodome. This free museum showcases the history of Japanese advertising. It is fascinatingly "quirky" to see how Japan marketed products in the Edo period vs. today.  
* **Note:** Closed Sundays and Mondays. *Since today is Sunday, skip this for today and visit later in the week if interested.*

### **6.2 Don Quijote (Roppongi or Ginza)**

* **The Ultimate Quirky Shop:** If "Standard Products" is too clean for you, **Don Quijote** is the chaos option. The Roppongi store is near your hotel, but the **Mega Don Quijote in Shibuya** is the most famous. It sells everything from KitKats to luxury watches in a jungle-like display.

## **7\. Summary of the Day**

* **07:00 \- 08:30:** Walk Shiba Park, Zojoji Temple, and climb Atago Shrine stairs.  
* **08:30 \- 09:30:** Breakfast at Le Pain Quotidien (Shiba Park).  
* **10:00 \- 10:30:** Transit to Ginza (Taxi recommended for ease).  
* **10:30 \- 12:30:** Shop at Itoya (Stationery) and Marronnier Gate (Standard Products/Uniqlo).  
* **12:30:** Lunch in Ginza (plenty of options) \+ Mont Blanc for dessert.  
* **Afternoon:** Walk the "Pedestrian Paradise" on Ginza main street.

This plan hits the walking, the "city center" shopping, the unique dessert, and the shrine visit, all paced for a family starting early on a Sunday.
